# MARCO-BOLO CSV-to-JSON-LD Tool

This repository contains a metadata publishing tool developed for **Work Package 1 (WP1)** of the [**MARCO-BOLO** project](https://marcobolo-project.eu/) (MARine COastal BiOdiversity Long-term Observations). WP1 focuses on data literacy and metadata flow across the project.

Learn more about WP1 here: [https://marcobolo-project.eu/work-packages/work-package-1](https://marcobolo-project.eu/work-packages/work-package-1)

This tool helps researchers and data managers transform metadata from structured CSV files into **JSON-LD** conforming to **Schema.org** and ready for harvesting by the [ODIS Catalog](https://catalog.odis.org/).

## Project Context

WP1 of MARCO-BOLO supports the production of high-quality, FAIR metadata. This repository provides the reference toolchain for transforming project metadata into a format compatible with global discovery platforms such as ODIS.

## How It Works

The tool uses:

- **[LinkML](https://linkml.io/)** to define metadata models (e.g., Dataset, Person, Organization)
- **[CSV-W](https://csvw.org/)** metadata files to describe CSV structure
- A **[Makefile](https://opensource.com/article/18/8/what-how-makefile)** and [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) to automate validation and transformation steps
- **[W3IDs](https://w3id.org/)** for stable context and schema identifiers of the metadata models.
- **[Schema.org](https://schema.org/)** as the target vocabulary for JSON-LD output

### Workflow Summary

flowchart TD
    A[Fill in CSV templates<br/>(e.g. Dataset.csv, Person.csv)] --> B[Commit changes to GitHub<br/>Triggers GitHub Actions]
    B --> C[Download JSON-LD artifact<br/>from GitHub Actions build]
    C --> D[Host JSON-LD file<br/>at a public web location]
    D --> E[Register JSON-LD endpoint<br/>with ODIS catalog]


1. Fill in CSV templates (e.g. `Dataset.csv`, `Person.csv`)
2. Commit changes; this kicks off GitHub Actions.
3. Download the JSON-LD files as an 'artifact' from the GitHub Action.
4. Make the JSON-LD publicly available on the internet as metadata for your resource (e.g. dataset)
5. Register the JSON-LD endpoint with [ODIS](https://catalog.odis.org)

### Getting Started (No Installation Required)
You can contribute metadata to MARCO-BOLO directly in your browser ‚Äî no need to install anything locally.

1. Create a GitHub Account
Go to https://github.com/signup and create a free GitHub account.

Contact the Work Package 1 (WP1) team to be added to the MARCO-BOLO organization and granted editing permissions. You won‚Äôt be able to contribute metadata until this is done.

2. Set Up Your GitHub.dev Environment
To edit metadata CSV files in a spreadsheet-like view:

Open the recommended GitHub.dev profile.

Click the ‚ÄúCreate‚Äù button.

If prompted, trust and install the ‚ÄúExcel Viewer‚Äù extension from MESCIUS. This enables spreadsheet-style editing of CSV files.

Tick the box: ‚ÄúUse this profile as the default for new windows‚Äù.

This configures your browser to open CSVs with a table-based view.

3. Edit Metadata in the Repo
Open the MARCO-BOLO metadata editor:
https://github.dev/marco-bolo/csv-to-json-ld/tree/wp1-playground

Sign in to GitHub when prompted and authorize GitHub.dev to access your account.

Browse to the relevant CSV file (e.g., Dataset.csv, Person.csv) and make edits using the table view.

4. Commit and Push Your Changes
Go to the Source Control view (left-hand sidebar).

Enter a short message describing your edits.

Click the + to stage your changes.

Click ‚ÄúCommit & Push‚Äù.

This will trigger an automatic build of your metadata on GitHub Actions.

5. Confirm Your Edits Were Valid
In the GitHub repository, switch to your working branch (e.g., wp1-playground).

Look for a build called validate-csvws-build-jsonld.

A green check mark means your changes passed validation.
A red cross means there were errors ‚Äî contact the WP1 team for help.

6. Download Your JSON-LD Output
In the build results, click ‚ÄúDetails‚Äù on the validate-csvws-build-jsonld job.

In the summary view, download the ZIP artifact that contains the generated JSON-LD files.

Note: These artifacts are temporary and will expire after 90 days. Be sure to store the files elsewhere for long-term access.

## Hosting and Registration

To make your metadata discoverable by ODIS:

1. **Host the generated JSON-LD** at a stable public URL (e.g., through GitHub Pages).
2. **Register the URL with ODIS** so it can be harvested and indexed.

## üìö Documentation & Resources

- [Rendered model documentation](http://lab.marcobolo-project.eu/csv-to-json-ld/index.html)
- CSV template and schema definitions in `/model/` and `/metadata/`
- Examples and outputs in `/examples/` and `/out/`

## ‚úÖ Required Fields and Validation Rules

Each CSV template has fields marked as **required**, and some fields must also follow **validation rules** (e.g., format restrictions or uniqueness constraints). These ensure your metadata is structured correctly and interoperable with global catalogs like [ODIS](https://catalog.odis.org).

## Required Table Terms and Relationships

Before filling out any MARCO-BOLO CSV tables, it's important to understand which terms are required and how they depend on each other. 

#### ‚úÖ Universal Required Fields

| Field                        | Meaning                                                                 |
|-----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `id`                        | A unique permanent identifier (e.g. `mbo_abc123`)                        |
| `metadataPublisherId`       | The ID of a Person or Organization who is publishing this metadata      |
| `metadataDescribedForActionId` | The ID of an Action that this record is describing (except for `Action.csv` itself) |

> üõ†Ô∏è `id` may not be explicitly marked as `required: true` in the YAML schema, but is always treated as required because it is the primary key in the CSV-W.
> In short, these relationships apply to *every other table* as well. No table stands alone ‚Äî they all describe a resource that must be attributed (publisher) and scoped (action).

### üß∞ User Tools

- [Table Dependency Viewer](./user_tools/dependency_viewer.html): See which tables are required or referenced for valid metadata records.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> ### üß± Minimum Required Files for a Dataset
> To create a valid `Dataset.csv` row, you must also provide records in:
>
> | File                                   | Why it's needed                                     |
> |----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
> | `Dataset.csv`                          | The dataset record itself                           |
> | `Action.csv`                           | To define the `metadataDescribedForActionId` value |
> | `Person.csv` **or** `Organization.csv` | To define the `metadataPublisherId` value          |

### üîç Validation Rules (SHACL Constraints)

The system also applies additional validation rules using [SHACL](https://www.w3.org/TR/shacl/). These rules ensure the integrity of the metadata graph:

| Rule | Type | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| **MBO Identifier Must Be Unique** | ‚ùå Violation | Each `id` (e.g. `mbo_tool_001`) must appear in only one CSV file. It cannot represent multiple entities across files. |
| **Entity Should Be Referenced** | ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning | Any entity you define (e.g. a `Person`, `Place`, or `SoftwareApplication`) should be referenced somewhere else in the metadata (e.g. as a `creator`, `location`, or `usedSoftware`). |

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Warnings won‚Äôt stop your JSON-LD from being generated, but violations will.
